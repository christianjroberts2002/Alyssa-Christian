            <h4>An Eternity Ahead</h4>
            <p>From Dancing in the Moonlight<br>
                To playing with our might<br>
                To Flying to Venus or Mars<br>
                It's been quite the sight.<br>
                <br>
                But between you and the stars <br>
                I'd pick you,<br>
                Who shines more bright <br>
                <br>
                Like 2 shooting stars watched closely <br>
                Our Celestial Orbits have crashed<br>
                Unlike any other <br>
                Because me and you are meant to be<br>
                Together at Last ❤️</p>

            <h4>Tulip Tn The Weeds</h4>
            <p>I found these tulips in the weeds<br>
                Quickly my mind thought of thee<br>
                In the great sea of tares<br>
                There is no beauty greater or fair<br>
                <br>
                Though this tulip dies to a seed<br>
                Soon we'll plant one for the eternities<br>
                Through rain, or drought, or hot beating rays<br>
                If I'm with you, come what may<br>
                <br>
                So if the universe tears you from me <br>
                And I below the ocean sea<br>
                I'll swim the ocean sea<br>
                To spend eternity with my Lyssie.</p>

            <h4>Valentines Day</h4>
            <p>Happy Valentines Day! The more time we spend together, I realize that Heavenly Father has placed you in my life right now for a special reason. 
                In the past couple of weeks that I've been able to get to know you better, I have already found many things that I love about you. 
                First is your testimony. I love hearing your comments and thoughts about the gospel and I look forward to continuing and growing those conversations.
                I love your desire to do what God wants for you. I love that you're a good listener, that you really listen to me and also talk things through, even if it's hard.
                 I love that you're so easy to have fun with and that you look for the little things that are meaningful like always opening my door, asking about my day and just being so sweet. I love discovering your hidden talents and seeing you laugh and smile. I love the patience, 
                 you always seem to have. I know you said you're grateful that I'm giving you a chance, but I am grateful to you that you are willing to be vulnerable and put yourself out there and give me a chance to come to know you. You're a wonderful man and I know that Heavenly Father is proud of who you are becoming. I am. 
                 I could go on and on but I hope you know how much you already mean to me. You are amazing and I feel very privileged to have someone so wonderful as my person.</p>

        <div class="birthday">
            <h4>Birthday Note</h4>
            <p>Happy Birthday to the love of my life. As I have thought about what to write to you for the past month or so, each time I get overwhelmed by the love I feel towards you. I love you with all of my heart. 
                Being with you these past 4 months officially (almost to the day) has helped me better understand a little bit more why a man and a woman need each other to gain exaltation. And I'm sure there's so much more to learn in the years we have ahead of us into the eternities.
                This greater understanding is hugely in part of your amazing example of righteousness, faith, trust, courage, and consistency. 
                I know you aren't perfect and I don't expect you to be. I love the daily effort you give and I can say that you inspire me. I cannot express the happiness I feel that it's you that God has led me to. When we first started dating, I often expressed to my mom my fears and worries about marriage, with all it entails. However, after those feelings,
                a reassuring thought always followed and continues to follow; if it's with you, I can do it. You give me courage and strength that many times I cannot find on my own. No matter if it's learning how to openly communicate my feelings and thoughts or talking about sex and having babies and the ideal way to make out without being embarrassed, I know that I can do it if it's with you (sometimes it's not right away and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your never-ending and love-filled patience with me).
                I love that you are a man who loves and knows your savior Jesus Christ. 
                You have taught me so much about Him as you've shared through church talks, mission homecoming, mission prep classes taught together, and one-on-one discussions, plus Come Follow Me with your wonderful family. Because of this, you are a blessing in my life that is one I think Heavenly Father daily for.
                Your faith in Christ is a powerful tool that I've been able to witness in these past months and I'm excited to see it grow alongside mine. You are not only a huge example through your testimony but for other reasons</p>

                <br> <span></span>

                <p>A week ago I gave you a bag of 72 things that I love and appreciate about you. 
                    I meant every word written and could go on and on about how amazing you are. 
                    If you ever forget it, just ask me and I'll remind you. I love your sweet. thoughtful and passionate heart.
                    I love the quirks that set you apart and the hidden talents that you continue to surprise me with.
                    I love that you have high ambitions and hopes and dreams. Now I just want to say thank you for choosing to love me. 
                    I know I'm not always easy but you seem to weather every step, trial, or stumbling block with grace, love, patience, and forgiveness. 
                    You remind me that I have talents and abilities to grow and use. You show me that I belong and am welcome and loved. 
                    You show me what commitments look like. You show me what selfless sacrifice looks like. Just as you chose me, I will always choose you. 
                    I love you so very much and hope that on this 21st birthday of yours, you remember how special you are. - lyss</p>
